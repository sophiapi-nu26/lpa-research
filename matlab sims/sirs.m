% SIRS
%
% Inputs:
% G = simple graph object representing the contact network
% x = vector of length ùëÅ whose elements are the initial states of each node in G
% dfinal = final day of the simulation (the initial day will be day 1)
% beta = model parameter for transition from 0 (susceptible) to 1 (infected)
% gamma = model parameter for transition from 1 (infected) to 2 (recovered)
% delta = model parameter for transition from 1 (infected) to 3 (deceased)
% xi = model parameter for transition from 2 (recovered) to 0 (susceptible)
%
% Outputs:
% X = N by dfinal matrix with the state history of the simulation
% S = vector of length dfinal containing the aggregate number of susceptible people for each day
% I = vector of length dfinal containing the aggregate number of infected people for each day
% R = vector of length dfinal containing the aggregate number of recovered people for each day
% D = vector of length dfinal containing the aggregate number of deceased people for each day

% ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS
%
% 1. Using the model parameters beta = 0.1, gamma = 0.2, delta = 0.01, and 
% xi = 0, with 2000 nodes and an average degree of 20, the peak daily
% infection rate for each of the 4 different types of graphs were:
% G1: about 1100
% G2: between 300 and 400
% G3: between 500 and 600
% G4: about 1100
% Hence, it seems like graph G2 had the lowest peak daily infection rate
%
% 2. Using the model parameters beta = 0.1, gamma = 0.2, delta = 0.01, and 
% xi = 0.01, with 2000 nodes and an average degree of 20, over 1000 days it
% seemed that in general, graphs G2 and G3 showed more likelihood of
% generating spotaneous spikes in the infection rate. Graphs G1 and G4 also
% had small spikes, but they were shorter and less pronounced as the spikes
% for G2 and G3.
